# 🚇 MetroMate

**MetroMate** is a console-based application designed to simulate a metro system, providing both user and admin functionalities. It was developed by a team of 6 members using C++ and QT, with extensive use of data structures. The system focuses on metro subscription management, fare calculation, and ride tracking.

## 📜 Overview

MetroMate offers users the ability to manage their rides and subscriptions, while administrators can manage trains, schedules, and fare rates. This project simulates a real-world metro system through a text-based interface, allowing users to interact with the system and access metro services.

## ⚙️ Features

### User Functionalities:
1. **Register/Sign Up**: Create a new account.
2. **Log In/Log Out**: Securely access and log out of the system.
3. **Purchase Subscription**: Buy from 3 different subscription types (Students, Public, Wallet).
4. **Manage Subscription**: View, renew, or upgrade your active plan.
5. **Check-In/Check-Out for Rides**: View available paths, calculate the shortest route, and check fares.
6. **View Ride History**: Access details of past rides including stations, dates, and fare.
7. **Update Personal Information**: Modify your account details.

### Admin Functionalities:
1. **User Management**: Add, edit, or delete user accounts.
2. **Metro Management**: Add, edit, or remove metro stations across different lines.
3. **Subscription Management**: Modify and manage user subscription plans.
4. **Ride Logs**: Access comprehensive ride logs from all users.
5. **Station Management**: View station-specific data like tickets sold, income, and passenger volume.
6. **Fare Management**: Adjust fare rates for different metro stages.

## 🚉 Metro Stages

- **Stage 1**: 6 LE for 1 to 9 stations.
- **Stage 2**: 8 LE for 10 to 16 stations.
- **Stage 3**: 12 LE for 17 to 23 stations.
- **Stage 4**: 15 LE for more than 23 stations.

### Subscription Plans

- **Students Cards**: Fixed fee every 3 months for 180 trips, with prices based on stages.
- **Public Cards**: Monthly or yearly plans for 60 or 730 trips.
- **Cash Wallet**: Rechargeable card with no time limit, charged per metro stage.

## 🛠️ Development Details

- **Graph Algorithms**: Used for searching the shortest paths between metro stations.
- **Data Structures**: Applied throughout to manage user accounts, ride history, subscriptions, and metro scheduling.
- **Technologies**: C++ and QT framework.

## 📝 Evaluation
The project will be evaluated based on the use of appropriate data structures, clean code, and the ability to explain design choices. Additional features like real-time system visualization, train management, and statistical reports may contribute to extra points.

## 🌟 Bonus Opportunities
GUI implementation
Zone-based subscriptions instead of stages
Train management and scheduling
Real-time system visualization with crowd simulation
## 💻 Development Tools
Use at least 3 different data structures.
File streams or databases are supported for data management.
Built-in libraries (STL) are allowed.

## Possible errors:
change the files locations (only files) to the location in your pc example: " D:/Qt/Metro-Mate/img/files/file_name.txt " because there was an error uploding the txt files to qres files in QT.
